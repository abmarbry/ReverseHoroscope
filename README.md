</br>
Reverse Horoscope is a console program designed to take the most appealing part of astrology--having others prompt you to think about yourself--and condensing it into one program that doesn't limit anyone to a specific sign. It takes parses daily horoscopes from two websites (mentioned below), takes your response to Reverse Horoscope's respective questions, and determines which star signs are most similar to your personality. It doesn't allow the user to take the same quiz twice in one day with a Date feature that tracks when the user last took the horoscope quiz. I might change this if it proves too inconvenient.

Though I am happy with the current program, future commits will include making the time it takes to parse the horoscope text in the beginning faster, transferring the program off the console after exploring Java's GUI, and smaller changes such as doing more with the Date, or computing connection max(es)/min(s). </p>
